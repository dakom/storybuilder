Example- The Very Hungry Caterpillar

1. Inciting Incident: protagonist's world is thrown out of balance in a relatable way

The egg is turned into a caterpillar and now needs to survive/grow  as a living organism (just as we do)

2. They now must take action to restore that balance via a clearly defined goal- and this action is the minimum effort to solve the problem

The caterpillar searches for food which is what it needs to survive and grow.
There is nothing simpler it could do, this is it

3. There’s something at stake if the protagonist does not achieve their goal- and it really matters to them (and ultimately, the audience)

If they don’t eat, they will die (and be unable to grow)

5. Protagonist’s true character/values are tested by “fighting” for the end goal

They keep searching/eating even as the requirements get more difficult and even as they get a stomach ache

6. Realistic antagonistic forces that are just a bit overwhelming at first

There is no food to be found at first

7. Antagonistic forces gain momentum davka from protagonist’s success

When the caterpillar eats too much, it gets stomach ache and can’t eat anymore.
As the caterpillar eats more, it gets bigger, and requires more food to be full

8. Antagonistic characters are motivated in opposite to protagonist

(_maybe could be stronger_)

This is caterpillar vs. nature- one could argue nature makes it inherently difficult to survive but it's not a desire exactly.

9. Basic feeling of progression

It requires more and more food to survive/grow, has a setback, moves forward- overall it's not static

10. Definitive irreversible ending

Becomes a butterfly who no longer needs so much food to survive/grow
