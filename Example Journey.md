1) Inciting Incident: Character's world is thrown out of balance

In Harry Potter, most people would probably say that this is Harry being told he's a wizard and invited to Hogwarts, but I disagree- I think it's his parents being killed by Voldemort. Depends on the angle of the story we're telling though.

As an exercise, we could take different stories and identify the inciting incident- asking what was their world like before and after it happened. 

2) They now must take action to restore that balance

In Harry Potter- assuming the above version of the inciting incident, this drives everything from his tolerating a mean foster family to going to wizard school to his extreme loyalty. Everything he does is to restore the balance that was taken from him at the death of his parents- including both to take down Voldemort and and to form a sort of surrogate family.

Different approaches writing writing here- from the outside in or inside out. Relying on one alone tends to be bad- e.g. forcing from the outside in, giving them a list of spectacles to do in order to entertain (it's why many stories fall flat).

Good writing notices that human beings are always lazy, we only do the bare minimum needed in order to accomplish the goal. So good writing makes it that the bare minimum the character must do is actually quite a lot (i.e. the bare minimum Harry Potter had to do in order to form a family and defeat Voldemort is everything he went through- it was both extreme and the easiest most natural path. Great writing. If he did that even though it would have been easier to just cast a simple spell, it would be bad- even if fun to watch the spectacle)

3) If they fail to do this- something important to them is at stake

Primarily, it need only be important to the character, however the audience must care about it too. For this reason, usually writers take the approach of making the protagonist somewhat likeable so that we care about what they care about. A great anti-hero that somehow pulls this off usually becomes extremely memorable (think The Godfather, though it's a bit of a cheat since he started out likeable)

We root for Harry to kill Voldemort to make Hogwarts safe and all- as well as for him to make friends and family

4) Every time they come closer to the goal, a *bigger* obstacle gets in the way- born davka out of their success

Again, good writing vs. bad writing- e.g. introducing cliche obstacles just to make it hard. This often isn't even *so* bad when done sparingly, but it can't be the only tool in the writer's toolbox.

Good writing makes it flow organically *by viewing the antagonist forces with the same perspective as above*. What would Voldemort do if his powers were stripped? What would Malfoy do if his father were taken away (by the judicial system)? etc.

Also- the "davka out of their success" part is crucial. Example- Harry successfully makes friends at Hogwarts. But now, they are a vulnerability he needs to protect. and from the antagonist's perspective- Malfoy is given the power he craves, but to keep it he must hurt people he somewhat cares about.

5) When they achieve their goal, it's unmistakable- and the balance has either been restored and lost forever, there's no going back

Example- Voldemort is gone, there's no coming back from that.
