# Goals - Spine

Has a conscious want and an unconscious need

# Effort

The character is forced to do something they otherwise wouldn't - usually risk something, in order to get closer to their goal

# Organic obstacles

These are the things that force the character into taking those risks. 

If it's another character, they need their own goals and it must be in _direct_ contradiction to the other character 
(otherwise they could both just get what they want)

# Progression - Gaps

Overcoming an obstacle typically results in another obstacle requiring more effort.

Things can fluctuate over the course of the story - they can get closer and farther to their goal

_Note: this might be a slight deviation from McKee, who might say it needs the gap needs to always open more and more_

# Arc

Ultimately, the character is moving from an initial, unrealized version of themselves, to a fully realized version of themselves

_Realized_ instead of _Rectified_ is important - a good villian should reach their full fruition as well.
