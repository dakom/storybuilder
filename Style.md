1. Show rather than tell

In general a character's desires etc. should be shown through the choices they make
Dialog can help reveal their inner desire, but in general action and choices and even performance alone are stronger

2. Subtext

"If the scene is about what the scene is about you're in trouble"

Try to remove lines and see if it can still be understood what's happening. 
If it's there, a smart actor will carry it with more strength than saying it on the nose

3. Cut the superfluous

If a scene is just for exposition or backstory, or values haven't changed from start to end - cut it
