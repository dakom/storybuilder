# Storybuilder

Currently a placeholder, concept is an interactive editor which follows Robert McKee's Story structure advice to enable building a story organically

For example - each beat might have the following criteria:

* Character Objective
* Initial Value at stake
* Expected Reaction
* Actual Reaction
* New Value

Each of those could be combined to build super-beats (scenes) super-super-beats (sequences) super-super-super beats (acts) and finally the overall turn of the story itself

Technically - the frontend would be web-based and could use some js graphing tool or maybe three.js. The backend will be built on appengine/go and leverage the auth system at the basic-api repo.
